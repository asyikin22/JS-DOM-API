# Demonstration of DOM-API

**Summary**: These codes demosntrate how to use JavaScript and Document Object Model (DOM) Application Programming Interface (API). 
* DOM-API is a set of interfaces and methods to manipute HTML file and allows javascript to interact with the content of web pages.

**Those features are**
* Add image changer - When user clicks on the image, a new image will be displayed. 
* Tailor personalized welcome message on the heading. After user key in their name, the heading will inlcude the new name in the heading
* Allow user to change name when they click "change user" button.

**Issues with these codes**
* The page doesnt seem to load properly while the browser asks user to input thier names. I might return to fix this because i had no idea how to do it now. lol.
